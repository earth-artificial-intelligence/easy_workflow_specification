# Easy Workflow Specification

Life is too complicated already and really no need to make it worse. The motivation of this specification is that the existing workflow languages are too complicated and much like an overkill for most people in many use cases. This is a new specification for describing workflows in easy JSON, and designed for people who wish to quickly spawn up workflows using plainest and straightforward format which can be reserved and reused easily. 

Note: This specification is incubated based on the customized format of scientific workflows in [Geoweaver](https://esipfed.github.io/Geoweaver/).
